# CodeSignalArcade
[Code Signal Arcade](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade) challenges using C# and BenchmarkDotnet to check different challenges solutions' performance.

## Disclaimer
Note that every challenge contains different approaches to solve the given problem, some of them are mine and others are provided by the Code Signal community in every challenge "Solutions" menu. Please, respect every approach no matter its performance, readability or complexity. The aim of this project is just to compare different approaches and their performance to help everyone improve their problem solving skills.

## Running Challenge's Benchmark
This project is built using `.NET 5` framework. If you want to modify the project's .NET version to run locally, you can modify the `<TargetFramework>` property in `CodeSignalArcade.csproj` file.

To run a challenge's benchmark type `dotnet run` in a terminal window at root folder. The program will print the list of available challenges, type challenge number (i.e. `14` to run "AlternatingSums") to run one of them.
